I'm happy to announce that this is officially on Github Pages and Jekyll [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
Setting it up was super easy. I just took forever to get to it. I have to give a super shout out to 
Jonathan Mcglone [jmcglone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), for writing the step by step guide
to getting this up without an Apple computer and all on Github. Thank you!
